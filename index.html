                One of my greatest personal strengths is my commitment and initiative. I am not happy until I have done my best and 
                thus achieved a good result. Personally, I think I am creative soul and have a good eye for design. Which I would love to 
                expand even more. I have many years of experience in the work experience and am very good with people. I am a new graduate 
                and want to enter working life and have my newly developed skills tested in a workplace I love. Personally, I think I 
                will get a lot of use for my experiences from previous jobs even though I am relatively new to this industry.

                      illustrator, 2D / 3D graphic artist, animator, photographer or graphic designer. We worked in a Mac 
                      environment with the Adobe suite, within which you can also could become certified in. We also used Wacom pro

                    Information architecture is the act of collecting, organizing, structuring information. Our task as 
                    information architect's is to structure data and find solutions that make the product more
                    usable and understandable.<br><br>
                    Therefore, the goal of this task was to get to know structure,
                    visualize, and potentially further develop content that one has not produced and designes you have not participated in
                    on designing.<br><br>
                    The goal was use content from existing solutions so one could understand how a realistic expectation (and
                    understanding) of the content you were working on helps you through the project from start to finish. Your ability to
                    keep track of your content gives you in many ways the role of project manager, despite being yours
                    main role is design and / or development.

                    The theme paper was about designing for a better world. In this theme we were supposed to create one
                    support campaign, consisting of a campaign website and a minimum of two or more ads, that
                    encouraged people to get involved in a cause. The theme for the assignment we choose ourselves. The campaign
                    could be about big or small issues related to health, sustainability, environment, animal welfare
                    etc.<br><br>
                     
                    It was important that the end product had a clear message and
                    call to action that links the campaign page to a (voluntary) organization that needs
                    attention, members or donations.

                    How can we make it as attractive as possible for consumers to use a new channel for delivery / sending packages to / from other consumers when they have bought / sold something used?
                    What does the most optimal customer journey look like, for both sending and receiving C2C packages? This was a short but fun project for a wellknown company called HeltHjem
                    For most people to want to use the concept, what associations should the concept create, and what should it be called?<br><br>
                    Create:
                    Visualization of the digital user journey related to the service, including a prototype showing the most important steps.
                    Name of the concept and a justification of the name choice with special emphasis on which associations you want to create.
                    A written description of their design

                        <p>
                          Over the last couple of years, games have become more and more common and widespread, 
                          especially throughout the younger generation. Today it’s used in everything from 
                          entertainment to learning experiences. Therefore, we need to look at what is often 
                          called “Serious Gaming ”. <br><br>
                          We will create a product that focuses on learning something, but at the same time 
                          focuses on the playful aspect out of it. In recent years, the IXD industry has begun 
                          to use elements known from the gaming industry in its products (Gamification). Today, 
                          game design theory is used on the web, in e-learning and app development.<br><br>
                          We will focus on what motivates a player in a ”Serious Game” to learn about a topic. 
                          In this project we were tasked with developing a physical game that must be able to be 
                          played in groups in high schools. We worked iteratively on a game concept. We had to 
                          teach ourselves to define problems and use game theory together with interaction design
                           and other subject areas to make this game. By using iterative processes we are supposed 
                           to should solve one and one problem at a time and always make sure that we have 
                           progression in on our game.</p>

                    Aftenposten is Norway's largest subscription newspaper with just over 250,000 subscriptions, 
                    of which more than 115,000 are purely digital subscriptions. But established media have an age problem.<br><br>

                    They struggle to remain relevant to a generation that has grown up with distractions and wires from digital media. 
                    But young people are still interested in knowing - reading, hearing and seeing - what is happening around them
                    
                    In this project, we were to prototype and present an interactive solution for Aftenposten that would ensure that 
                    young people between 18-25 years visit aftenposten.no regularly to get news and information about what is happening 
                    around them.<br><br>
                    
                    Good interaction design is the result of a thorough process and requires that one designs and tests a variety of 
                    different solution proposals. The process must be documented in an appropriate way, with clear arguments for the 
                    choice of methods, as well as design choices made along the way.

                    In this project I was introduced to design as a storytelling tool, and also a practical introduction 
                    of the design tool Adobe XD and Photoshop. I would focus on mastering and deepening basic skills 
                    that I had acquired during the first semester of the study. The project assignment was to design and develop
                     a responsive website for a custom target group.<br><br>
                     A good book / magazine cover is almost like a window into a universe full of wonderful, weird, romantic, 
                     sad, eccentric or enlightening events, stories, characters, people and philosophies.<br><br>
                    The website should present and sell a book, magazine or cartoon. It was also important that the website 
                    served as an introduction to the book's universe and created curiosity and interest.
